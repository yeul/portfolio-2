                  Beginning with a deeper understanding of the products and services our customers provide, we discuss what the goals of the project are. What is the website
                  setting out to achieve? Who is the audience? What message are we conveying? What kind of interactivity do we wish to provide? Taking time to answer these
                  questions allows us to conceptualize a design that will satisfy all of these needs and more in order to propel brands forward.
